Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
</p><h3>General biology and habitat</h3><p>Chickens are omnivores.[25] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[26] or young mice.[27]

    The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[28] The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[29]
    
    Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed.
